MOREBS
=======
Is a collection of methods and classes written in Python to aid in data generation. Work restructured from my previous project, DER.

Could be installable by
```
sudo python3 setup.py install
```

Features
=========
- `main.py` file not yet coded.
- some information on the code can be found in the `docs` @ `docs/build/index.html`. To update the documentation there, do 
    `sphinx-build -b html docs/source/ docs/build/html`
after getting sphinx-docs installed. 

Update 11/13/22
===============
- I am expecting to write some further documentation for the code in this project before moving on to writing the main file.

*NOTE* otherwise, all of this code is spaghetti code and then I would have no job as a software developer/engineer. Just kidding!!
